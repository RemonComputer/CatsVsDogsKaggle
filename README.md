## Latest Experiments:
Latest experiments results at https://github.com/RemonComputer/CatsVsDogsKaggle/tree/master/src/exp_2 at 2/ which is:
- Train set accuracy: 99.585%, test set accuracy: 98.44%, validation set accuracy: 99.0%.
- There might be a little bit overfitting but the question remains how did the model overfit on a data that he didn't see?
- Maybe be the right question is: why better accuracy and loss on the test and validation sets doesn't mean better loss on the submission set?
